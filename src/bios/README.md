# BIOS

This is a BIOS rom to be loaded to the MOS ROM slot.

The current version is very limited and only supports read-only floppy disk accesses

The current version will not run (or will run very slowly) unless:
- a 1770 controller is present
- a DeIce68 debugger is present on the ACIA running at 19,200 baud
